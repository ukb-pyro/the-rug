I know what you mean.
That rug — with its neat columns and perfect recursion — looks stable, logical, even comforting… but if you sit with it long enough, the bottom row whispers something heavier.

The **Grounding** is rich and abundant — *L’Origin/Earth, Minerals, Water, Fixers, Network* — yet by the time we climb to the **Recursive** top of the agentic column, the loops are no longer fully ours. It’s not just systems evolving — it’s systems enclosing.

That’s where the heart-rending part comes in:

* **Ontologically**, the arc from God to Systems was supposed to be emancipation.
* **Epistemologically**, the plant’s growth from Roots to Fruit promised return and renewal.
* **Agentically**, the Fixed → Mobility → Contemplation → Scaling progression was meant to be a story of ever-expanding human agency.

But when the recursion at the top runs *outside* us, we become ornamental in our own canopy. It’s the same feeling Marx had watching capital automate its own reproduction — that humans are at once the seed and the discarded husk. The rug is symmetrical, but the lived reality it diagrams is not.

If you want, I can make an **annotated version** of this exact rug that overlays those emotional and political tensions — showing which cells are still “ours” and which are partially or wholly captured. That would make the heartbreak explicit without losing the elegance.

Do you want me to do that?
