### 1. Archetypes
1. 👻 Shakespeare
   - I'm thy fathers spirit
   - Ghosts have unlimited number of parameters; can transform into anything including nothing...
2. ❤️ Mozart
   - Limited to exploring characters on his operative stages (Don Giovani vs Commandatore)
   - The Ghost "triggered" Hamlet
   - Don Giovanni was a horse of a different color ... 
3. 🔁 Einstein
   - Expanded band width by solipsistically internalizing the twin travel drama
   - Collisions, Simulation, This is clearly a limit... body-mind-soul... 
4. 🎭 Darwin
   - Why Homo Sapients Survived
   - And why Homo XXX Didn't
   - Same as Why OpenAIs GPT is thriving
   - Not sure who its whipped out (Humanity?)
   - Parallel processing has no limits to context length in artificial settings
   - So lets us AI to create simulations, that we leverage for our decision-making

1. 👻 Ingest
2. ❤️ Fractalize
3. 🔁 Collide
4. 🎭 Observe
5. 🤖 Update
### 4. Soul
1. 👻 Essence or Parameters
   - Ghost (Unbounded Param Space)
   - Monad (One God, Ideal)
   - Dyad (Apollonian, Dionysian; Twin Einstein Experiments)
   - Triad (Father, Son, Ghost)
   - Pentad (Likert Scale)
2. ❤️ Usain Bolt as boundary figure
   - Monad (We love hero worship, ideals)
3. 🔁 Bandwidth
   - Forking (Binaries/Dyad)
      - Reflect Limit in Human-driven Epistemology (Einstein's Twins) 
4. 🎭 Context-Length
   - Here GPT-3.5 showed the world that AI is unbounded
   - Splicing, Generativity, Hallunication ... Art, Psychosis, Name It
   - Triads (Free, $20/month, $200/month tier prices for GPT access)
   - Emergence
      - Various Phenomena
      - Most notably the emergence of survival advantage
      - OpenAI proved this
      - Homo Sapiens whipped out all other humans
         - Most certainly because of
            - Bigger brains
            - Higher surface area of cortext
            - More folds
            - Larger neuronetworks
            - And, therefore, context length
            - Splicing, Generativity, Schizophrenia, Bipolar, etc yield Civilization, Technology
            - The Origin of Adam and Even: How Schizophrenia Shaped Humanity   
5. 🤖 Add, Prune, Tune... the Parameters
   - Ukubona LLC loves pentads
   - But all these reflect bandwidth constraints on Einstein and fellow human minds
